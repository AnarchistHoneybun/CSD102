Algorithm: The program uses a simple linear search to determine whether or not
a given string is a subset of another string. This is done by checking every
character of the smaller string against the larger string, using the strchr()
function.

Time and Space complexity: The program checks for m characters in the string
with length N, and uses linear search to do so. Thus, the time complexity of 
this process comes out to O(m*N).

Memory for the two strings is allocated dynamically, which comes out to a total
of m+N characters. Thus, the space complexity is O(m+N).
