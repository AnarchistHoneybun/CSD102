Algorithm: The program first constructs a flow network G' from the 
given directed graph G. Then the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is applied
to find the maximum flow (f) in the network. If f is less than k,
the program dtermines that no solution exists and reports as such.
Otherwise, k paths are extracted from the graph and edges are removed
at each step so that no paths have a common edge.

Time and Space complexity: Overall, the time complexity is determined by
the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which can be approximated to O(k*E*f).

The space complexity comes out to O(V^2) due to the storage of the graph
and flow network.
